## Moving to `codeberg.org`

I am in the process of switching to Codeberg as my main Git host

Most of my existing repositories here on GitHub will be archived, and any further development will happen on Codeberg.\
Also, new repositories will typically only be created over there

Please visit [my Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/sstorsveen) if you would like to see what I am working on
